    What the computer is made of vs what is on the computer
        A set of calculations to execute vs a collection of functions performing together
    The language that computers use and the language that humans use
        An interpreter does one statement and the compiler scans the whole program


The 5 parts
    The way the computer wants it and the way that humans can understand it
        Input devices are such as keyboard and mouse that will tell the cpu that something happened
        The cpu is the brains of the operation and can crunch number and equations, as long as itâ€™s told what to do
        Main memory saves all the long term data, like files programs and cat pictures.
        Secondary memory is short term data storage and will save stuff like where your mouse is on the screen or what netflix show your watching
        Output devices are mainly the monitor and will display what the cpu tells it.
